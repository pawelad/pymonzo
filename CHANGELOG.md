## Unreleased
### Added
- Add `counterparty` field support to Monzo transactions.
  (by [@csogilvie](https://github.com/csogilvie)
  in [#34](https://github.com/pawelad/pymonzo/issues/34))

### Changed
- Stop being strict with certain Monzo enums and allow any string values.

  Specifically, account's `type`, `currency` and transaction's `decline_reason`.
- Changed `empty_str_to_none` logic to be in line with `empty_dict_to_none`.

### Fixed
- Use 'form data' instead of 'query params' for relevant Monzo API endpoints.

  Previously, these endpoints (incorrectly) sent request arguments through 'query
  params' and not 'form data':
  - `AttachmentsResource.upload()` (`POST /attachment/upload`)
  - `AttachmentsResource.register()` (`POST /attachment/register`)
  - `AttachmentsResource.deregister()` (`POST /attachment/deregister`)
  - `FeedResource.create()` (`POST /feed`)
  - `PotsResource.deposit()` (`PUT /pots/{pot_id}/deposit`)
  - `PotsResource.withdraw()` (`PUT /pots/{pot_id}/withdraw`)
  - `TransactionsResource.annotate()` (`PATCH /transactions/{transaction_id}`)
  - `WebhooksResource.register()` (`POST /webhooks`)
- Add (more) missing transaction decline reasons.

  in [#42](https://github.com/pawelad/pymonzo/pull/42))
- Add (more) missing account types. (by [@m-roberts](https://github.com/m-roberts)
  in [#38](https://github.com/pawelad/pymonzo/pull/38))
- Fix listing transactions with `expand_merchants=True` when `suggested_tags` isn't
  present. (by [@csogilvie](https://github.com/csogilvie)
  in [#34](https://github.com/pawelad/pymonzo/issues/34))
- Allow transaction category to be any string. Monzo supports custom categories
  as part of their "Plus" plan.

## [v2.1.0](https://github.com/pawelad/pymonzo/releases/tag/v2.1.0) - 2024-04-16
### Added
- Add `rich` support to `MonzoPot`.

### Changed
- When using `rich`, make transaction title red if the amount is negative.
- Update `codecov/codecov-action` GitHub Action to v4.

## [v2.0.1](https://github.com/pawelad/pymonzo/releases/tag/v2.0.1) - 2024-04-13
### Fixed
- Monzo pot `goal_amount` is not always present.
  (by [@csogilvie](https://github.com/csogilvie)
  in [#32](https://github.com/pawelad/pymonzo/pull/32))
- Add missing account types.
  (by [@csogilvie](https://github.com/csogilvie)
  in [#31](https://github.com/pawelad/pymonzo/pull/31))
- Add missing space to `NoSettingsFile` exception message.

## [v2.0.0](https://github.com/pawelad/pymonzo/releases/tag/v2.0.0) - 2024-03-07
### Added
- Add (optional) `rich` and `babel` support.
- Add `expand_merchant` parameter to `TransactionsResource.list`. It's not very 
  clear in the API docs, but it works on that endpoint as well.
- Add custom `NoSettingsFile` exception. It's raised when the access token wasn't
  passed explicitly to `MonzoAPI()` and the settings file couldn't be loaded.

### Changed
- Update `MonzoTransactionMerchant` schema with new fields returned by the API.
- Simplify `MonzoAPI` initialization.
  This (unfortunately) needed an API change because the current attributes (in 
  hindsight) didn't really make sense.
  Now, you can either use an already generated (and temporary) access
  token, or generate it with `MonzoAPI.authorize()` and load from disk.

### Fixed
- Make `MonzoTransaction.settled` validator run in `before` mode.
- Add new `MonzoTransactionDeclineReason` values missing from Monzo API docs.
- Add new `MonzoTransactionCategory` values missing from Monzo API docs.
- Remove Markdown links from PyPI package description.

  in [#5](https://github.com/pawelad/pymonzo/pull/5))
